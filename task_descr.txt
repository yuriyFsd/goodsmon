Send product alert only if price has been changed
1. store product info to db: url, title, prices, status (maybe separate table with statuses), update time
2. compare current price with stored, if changed - send alert and update status and time

{
  category: id
  title: '',
  vendor_domain: '',
  url: '',
  prices: [],
  last_update_time: time,
  status: id
}

category: {
  
}

status: {
  on discount,
  not available,
  regular price
}
